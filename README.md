# Description
In this project, I have implemented an AI player to play Tic-Tac-Toe optimally. The primary algorithm used for the AI player is the Minimax algorithm, which allows the computer to make strategic moves to maximize its chances of winning or minimize the chances of losing.

Additionally, the project includes the implementation of the alpha-beta pruning algorithm. This enhancement makes the computer play more efficiently by reducing the number of unnecessary branches explored during the decision-making process.
